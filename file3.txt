| Men flow into life, and ebb into death. |
| Some are filled with life; Some are     |
| empty with death; Some hold fast to     |
| life, and thereby perish, For life is   |
| an abstraction. Those who are filled    |
| with life Need not fear tigers and      |
| rhinos in the wilds, Nor wear armour    |
| and shields in battle; The rhinoceros   |
| finds no place in them for its horn,    |
| The tiger no place for its claw, The    |
| soldier no place for a weapon, For      |
| death finds no place in them.           |
|                                         |
